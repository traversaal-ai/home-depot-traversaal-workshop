        "# Deep Dive Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
        "\n",
        "An Agentic RAG is required when we use reasoning to determine which action(s) to take and in which order to take them. Essentially we use agents instead of a LLM directly to accomplish a set of tasks which requires planning, multi step reasoning, tool use and/or learning over time. Agents give us agency!\n",
        "\n",
        "Agency : The ability to take action or to choose what action to take\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of RAG, we can plug in agents to enhance the reasoning prior to selection of RAG pipelines, within a RAG pipeline for retrieval or reranking and finally for synthesising before we send out the response. This improves RAG to a large extent by automating complex workflows and decisions that are required for a non trivial RAG use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose of this Agentic RAG\n",
        "This notebook presents a practical implementation of Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)‚Äîa system where decision-making and tool selection are delegated to an intelligent agent before executing a response. Rather than passing every query through a static RAG pipeline, this system introduces agency‚Äîthe ability to choose the best course of action depending on the nature of the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the heart of this implementation is a router prompt, which classifies user queries into one of three categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "- OpenAI documentation: Queries related to tools, APIs, or usage guidelines for OpenAI models\n",
        "- 10-K financial reports: Questions requiring retrieval from company filings or financial datasets\n",
        "- Live Internet search: Broader, current, or comparative queries that need web access\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the query is classified, the system invokes a corresponding route handler:\n",
        "\n",
        "- For OpenAI and 10-K queries, it retrieves relevant context from a vector database (Qdrant) using text embeddings, then applies a RAG-based response generator.\n",
        "- For Internet queries, it fetches real-time information using a web-access API (ARES).\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach is an example of Agentic RAG, where reasoning precedes retrieval and generation. By plugging in agents before and within the RAG pipeline, we make the system smarter and more adaptive. This allows us to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Automatically choose the right retrieval method based on context\n",
        "- Combine structured knowledge with real-time search\n",
        "- Scale RAG beyond trivial use cases by integrating multi-step decision logic\n",
        "\n",
        "Importantly, no external agentic frameworks are used‚Äîthis is a ground-up implementation that demonstrates how to build a lightweight but intelligent agentic system using only a language model, prompt engineering, and retrieval tools."

As a result, the retrieval engine performs only one operation on the vector databases or external tools, which often leads to incomplete or less relevant results.\n",

By handling these subqueries separately, the agent can generate more complete and relevant responses."
