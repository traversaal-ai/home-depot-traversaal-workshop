This notebook will introduce you to the fundamentals of building AI agents that can reason, use tools, and work together to solve complex tasks.\n\n## What is Google ADK?\n\nGoogle ADK (Agent Development Kit) is a framework for building production-ready AI agents powered by Google's Gemini models. It provides:\n\n- **Agents**: AI-powered entities that can reason, plan, and take actions\n- **Tools**: Functions that agents can call to interact with the external world\n- **Orchestration**: Ways to combine multiple agents for complex workflows\n- **Sessions**: Conversation management and state persistence\n- **Runtime**: Infrastructure to execute agents and handle their interactions\n\nBy the end of this notebook, you'll understand:\n1. How to create basic conversational agents\n2. The different types of agents available in ADK\n3. How to equip agents with tools\n4. How to manage agent execution and conversations\n\nLet's start by setting up our environment!",

You've learned the fundamentals of Google ADK:\n\n### 1. **Agents Come in Different Types**\n- **LLM Agents**: For reasoning and tool use\n- **Workflow Agents**: For orchestrating multiple agents (Sequential, Parallel, Loop)\n\n### 2. **Tools Extend Agent Capabilities**\n- Function tools are Python functions with descriptive docstrings\n- Agents decide when and how to use tools based on context\n- Tools can return success or error states\n\n### 3. **Sessions and Runners Manage Execution**\n- Sessions maintain conversation context\n- Runners execute agents and handle the event stream\n- Events show the agent's reasoning process\n\n### 4. **Progressive Complexity**\n- Start with simple conversational agents\n- Add tools for external interactions\n- Combine agents for complex workflows\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you understand the basics, you can:\n1. Create custom tools for your specific needs\n2. Build multi-agent workflows with Sequential and Parallel agents\n3. Explore built-in tools for BigQuery, Search, and more\n4. Check out the [official ADK documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs) for advanced features\n\nIn the next notebook, we'll build a real-world data orchestration pipeline using these concepts!",
