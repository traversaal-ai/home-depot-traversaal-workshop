    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've learned the fundamentals of Google ADK:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Agents Come in Different Types**\n",
    "- **LLM Agents**: For reasoning and tool use\n",
    "- **Workflow Agents**: For orchestrating multiple agents (Sequential, Parallel, Loop)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Tools Extend Agent Capabilities**\n",
    "- Function tools are Python functions with descriptive docstrings\n",
    "- Agents decide when and how to use tools based on context\n",
    "- Tools can return success or error states\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Sessions and Runners Manage Execution**\n",
    "- Sessions maintain conversation context\n",
    "- Runners execute agents and handle the event stream\n",
    "- Events show the agent's reasoning process\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Progressive Complexity**\n",
    "- Start with simple conversational agents\n",
    "- Add tools for external interactions\n",
    "- Combine agents for complex workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand the basics, you can:\n",
    "1. Create custom tools for your specific needs\n",
    "2. Build multi-agent workflows with Sequential and Parallel agents\n",
    "3. Explore built-in tools for BigQuery, Search, and more\n",
    "4. Check out the [official ADK documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs) for advanced features\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we'll build a real-world data orchestration pipeline using these concepts!"
