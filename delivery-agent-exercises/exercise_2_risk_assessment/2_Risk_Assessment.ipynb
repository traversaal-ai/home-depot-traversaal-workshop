    "# Exercise 2: Delivery Risk Assessment with External AI Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous exercise, we collected comprehensive delivery data by orchestrating multiple agents. Now we'll take that data and perform sophisticated risk assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Big Picture: Building Toward Intelligent Case Cards\n",
    "\n",
    "We're building a complete **Delivery Intelligence System** that helps prevent delivery failures. Here's how this exercise fits in:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Data Collection (Exercise 1) ‚Üí collected_order_data.json\n",

    "### What We'll Build in This Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **External AI Model Integration** - Calling a risk assessment model (simulating your proprietary model)\n",
    "2. **Multi-Factor Risk Analysis** - Weather, customer, and route risk factors\n",
    "3. **MCP Integration** - Using real weather data via Model Context Protocol\n",
    "4. **Risk Aggregation** - Combining all assessments into structured insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Final Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of all exercises, we'll produce intelligent case cards that GOAs can use to:\n",
    "- Identify high-risk deliveries before they fail\n",
    "- Send pre-drafted, policy-compliant messages to customers\n",
    "- Communicate specific requirements to carriers\n",
    "- Suggest alternative delivery solutions\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise demonstrated several important patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **External Model Integration**\n",
    "- Easy to integrate existing AI models into ADK workflows\n",
    "- Used pre-calculated risk scores from BigQuery data\n",
    "- Simple to swap between different model providers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration**\n",
    "- Connected to external weather service via MCP\n",
    "- Weather agent uses `MCPToolset` to call the weather risk assessment\n",
    "- MCP server provides standardized interface for external services\n",
    "- Easy to switch between demo mode and real weather APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Multi-Factor Risk Analysis**\n",
    "- Parallel agents assess different risk dimensions\n",
    "- Specialized tools for specific risk factors\n",
    "- Comprehensive view beyond single model assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Production Considerations**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Instead of our demo model:\n",
    "model = GenerativeModel(\"gemini-1.5-flash\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# You would use:\n",
    "# Option 1: Your proprietary model endpoint\n",
    "response = requests.post(\"https://your-model.api/assess\", json=order_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Option 2: Claude from Model Garden\n",
    "model = GenerativeModel(\"claude-3-sonnet@20240229\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Option 3: Your custom Vertex AI model\n",
    "endpoint = aiplatform.Endpoint(\"your-endpoint-id\")\n",
    "response = endpoint.predict(instances=[order_data])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Actionable Insights**\n",
    "- Not just risk scores, but specific recommendations\n",
    "- Comparison between models for validation\n",
    "- Clear prioritization of mitigation actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Benefits of MCP**\n",
    "- **Standardized Interface**: All MCP servers follow the same protocol\n",
    "- **Language Agnostic**: Can use MCP servers written in any language\n",
    "- **Easy Integration**: MCPToolset makes it simple to add external services\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Switch between local development and production services\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next exercise, we'll take these risk assessments and:\n",
    "1. Analyze product characteristics for special handling needs\n",
    "2. Calculate priority scores based on multiple factors\n",
    "3. Generate intelligent insights for delivery optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The modular design means you can easily:\n",
    "- Replace the external model with your own\n",
    "- Add new risk factors\n",
    "- Customize the output format\n",
    "- Integrate with your existing systems\n",
    "- Switch MCP servers for different weather providers"

    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1: Adjust Risk Thresholds\n",
    "Modify the `assess_weather_risk` function to change the precipitation thresholds:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Current: risk_score = 8 if precipitation > 0.5\n",
    "# Try: risk_score = 6 if precipitation > 0.3\n",
    "```\n",
    "Run the pipeline again and see how it affects the overall risk assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2: Add a New Risk Factor\n",
    "Add code to check if the delivery window is during rush hour (7-9 AM or 4-6 PM):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# In assess_route_risk function, check:\n",
    "window_start = order_data.get('WINDOW_START')\n",
    "# If window overlaps with rush hour, add 2 to risk_score\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3: Customize Recommendations\n",
    "In the risk_aggregation_agent instruction, add logic to generate specific recommendations based on risk scores:\n",
    "- If weather_risk > 6: \"Schedule delivery for better weather day\"\n",
    "- If customer has special notes: \"Call customer before delivery\"\n",
    "- If route_risk > 7: \"Use experienced driver familiar with area\"\n",

    "Create a simple MCP server that provides traffic data:\n",
    "1. Copy the weather_mcp_server.py as a template\n",
    "2. Create a \"get_traffic_conditions\" tool\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that we set the session state **before** creating the Runner. This is crucial because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The ADK framework attempts to substitute template variables (like `{order_data}`) when agents are initialized\n",
    "2. If the session state isn't populated yet, you'll get a `KeyError` about missing context variables\n",
    "3. By setting the state first, the agents can properly access the data during initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current implementation, we've also updated the agent instructions to parse data from the user message instead of relying solely on template substitution, making the system more robust."
