Brushless motors often offer better efficiency and longer tool life.\n*   **Power Drill - Combo Kit Hammer Drill (SKU-GFYB69MH-R2):** This combo kit is $50.12, also slightly more than your current order. A hammer drill is great for drilling into tougher materials like masonry.\n*   **Power Drill - Lightweight Corded 6 Amp (SKU-GFYB69MH-R3):** This corded option is priced at $42.68, which is less than your current drill. Corded drills offer continuous power without needing to worry about battery life.\n\nSo, Kayla, would you like to:\n1.  **Cancel the order for the Power Drill (WJ21091082) entirely** since it's still pending?\n2.  **Consider one of the recommended alternative power drills** instead? If so, which one interests you the most?\n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed!",

However, I could not find any hammer associated with your customer ID: AMMQJ2I0WTM94Z3KYR.\n\nCould you please confirm if you have a different order number for the hammer you are trying to return?

Typically, for damaged items or items without a clear purchase record, we would recommend taking the item to your nearest Home Depot store. The store associates can assess the item and, in many cases, offer an exchange for a similar item or provide store credit at the item's lowest selling price.\n\nTo help you further, could you recall any more specific details about the hammer? For example, what kind of hammer was it (e.g., claw hammer, sledgehammer, framing hammer), or perhaps the approximate price you paid? Knowing this might help us look for alternatives in our current inventory if a direct return or exchange at the store isn't feasible or if you'd prefer to explore replacement options.\n\nWould you like me to help you find a suitable alternative hammer from our current selection, or would you prefer to take the damaged one to a store for assessment?",
